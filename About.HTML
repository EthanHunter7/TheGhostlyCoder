                    <p>Then after 6 years I have had a change of heart.I was looking around for a change and a friend introduced me to coding. 
                    I did a couple of tasks and ever since ive been working on increasing my knowleadge on it.It is very fun and satisfing when learning code 
                    and also writing it making projects.

                    I love the problem solving involved in it. It so satisfing to make all of the code look and feel tidy. 
                    The best part is when you finsih a task / project it gives off a nice feeling.
