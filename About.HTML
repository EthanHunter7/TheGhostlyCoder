                <p>Lets us start with my name. My name is Ethan Hunter. Im 21 and was born in Newcastle  and have just rectently started coding. 
                I started out when i was 15 becoming a chef because i had a passion for the culinary arts. 
                Then after 6 years I have had a change of heart.I was looking around for a change and a friend introduced me to coding. i did a couple of tasks and ever since ive been working on increasing my knowleadge on it. 
                It is very fun and satisfing when learning code and also writing it making projects I love the problem solving involved in it. It so satisfing to make all of the code look and feel tidy. 
                The best part is when you finsih a task / project it gives off a nice feeling.
