# The Ghostly Coder Project 
The Ghostly Coder Porject is project made for the Baltic Apprenticeships Software Academy.

This Project was made with HTML/PHP/CSS and a little bit of JS.

The Baltic Apprenticeships Software Academy was a 2 week bootcamp where for the week we were taught the fundementals of HTML and PHP. Then for week 2 we were asked to make a web form with the skills we had learnt and through research. I also said CSS was used but they did not teach us any of the CSS that was all done under my own research and I also add a little bit of JS on my own as well . 

## A Look Into My Project 
---
This is a look into the project I was able to produce in the week I was given to make the project.

### Home Page 
---

This is the welcome page to my project for when you first land into the site. 

I know the welcome header looks a bit blury but thats what it is supposed to look like as it has a blur animation I added to it using CSS so when you have the website open it will slowly blur from the left to the right. 

As for the little ghost in the middle of the page I added a little ghost which follows the mouse cursor around using JS. 

Then when you click contiune it will take you to the next page which is the form page.

### Form Page
---
So once you've clicked continue on the welcome page this is the page which comes up.

![Form Page](/ScreenShots/Form%20Page.png) 

This is the form page and for the Bootcamp, we were required to do a name, email, gender, date of birth, and 4 extra fields. I added a couple more fields than that just so I could lay it out the way I have.

It also has the key at the top telling you what the star sign is for. 

As you can see at the top of the page under the header there is a Nav bar and the form tab is highlighted I have done this so the user knows what page they are currently on.

If you click submit with out adding anything into the required fields then this will happen.

This shows you in text that the fields are required to be filled out and I have put them in red to show that it is an error.

Then to show you that all the fields can be filled out and typed in I have a screenshot here just to show you but it also there to show you the fields also submit all the information correctly.

### Submit Page
---
Then when you click submit with at least the required fields filled out it will `$POST` them to another page showing you the information you have put down.

![Submit Page](/ScreenShots/Submit%20Page%20With%20Information%20On.png)

As you can see all the information that was put into the form fields shown to you with the title shown you which is which. 

As you can also see if you have a look at the Nav bar at the top non of them are highlighted because there is no submit page tab to show you are on it so it shows you are not on any of them pages.

### About Me Page 
---
This is an extra page which was no required but I added it because I had little spare time to add it add the end of the week before finishing up the Bootcamp

I just thought about adding it to the page just so the people in the Boot camp could get to know me a little bit more in who I a, what I do, and what i enjoy.

### Final Comments
---
This was my first big project to complete and was an up and down joureny to the end. I really enjoyed making it and solving problems I had within my code and figuring out how to create the layout with CSS.
